The Page Object Model (POM) is a design pattern used in test automation to represent web pages as objects. In Playwright, the POM pattern helps in organizing and maintaining your test code by encapsulating the interaction with web elements on a page within dedicated page classes. This separation of concerns makes your tests more readable, reusable, and maintainable.

Here's a basic explanation of how the POM pattern works in Playwright:

Page Classes: Each web page is represented by a dedicated class that contains methods to interact with the elements on that page. For example, you might have a LoginPage class for the login page, a HomePage class for the home page, and so on.

Element Locators: Inside each page class, you define locators for the elements on that page. Locators can be CSS selectors, XPath expressions, or any other method supported by Playwright to locate elements.

Page Methods: Page classes also contain methods that represent actions or operations that can be performed on the page. For example, a LoginPage class might have a login(username, password) method that fills in the username and password fields and clicks the login button.

Test Scripts: In your test scripts, you create instances of the page classes and use their methods to interact with the web pages. This keeps your test scripts clean and focused on the test logic, without having to deal with the details of element locators and interactions
